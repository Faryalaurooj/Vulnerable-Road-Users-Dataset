# Vulnerable-Road-Users-Dataset
THis repository contains a deep learning approach for detection and tracking of Vulnerable road users (VRUs) for faciliatating self driving vehicles and assiting human drivers for safety of VRUs. 
VRUs include all live actors which can be hit by moving vehicles on roads and are prone to much larger damage as compared to other cars.

## Requirements

This dataset is labelled for 03 classes namely people , tricycles and bicycles. 

VisDrone dataset is downloaded and reformatted and re annotated for developing this specific dataset
It is in .txt format this it can be used to train YOLO models for object detection tasks
